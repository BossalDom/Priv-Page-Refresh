FAQ General Questions What is affordable housing and how does it work? Through Housing Connect, you can find and apply for affordable rental and homeownership opportunities. To qualify, your household must meet the income and size requirements for a unit in the affordable development. Your household is all of the people who will live in the affordable unit. Housing is considered affordable if it costs about one-third or less of what the people living there get in income. The New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) and Housing Development Corporation (HDC) create affordable housing opportunities for many household income levels and sizes. The buildings are privately owned. HPD and HDC have a monitoring and oversight role. Application Questions I can’t find my verification code. Housing Connect uses two-step verification for creating your account. Your Housing Connect verification code is sent to a different email (or phone number) than your confirmation email. Check the email address or phone number that you entered as your additional contact info when you signed up. If you’re still having trouble, check out the Housing Connect training video titled ‘Account Setup’. Where do I apply for new buildings availabilities instead of re-rentals? Online: Apply online through Housing Connect when the lottery opens. For detailed instructions, review the Housing Connect Guidebook. By mail: Paper applications can be requested. The address to request a paper application will be updated once the lottery has officially launched. Where do I enter my information? After you have created your account, you can view, add, and edit your information from the “My Household” page. After logging in, you’ll see your name with an arrow next to it in the top right-hand corner of the page. Click your name, and a dropdown menu will appear. Click the “My Household” option. This page shows your Household Summary, Household Members, and Housing Choices. Click the light grey “Edit” buttons on the right of each section to add your information. For detailed instructions, see How to Apply. The website is not working and I can’t apply. If you’re still having trouble after reviewing the Applying Online instructions and Housing Connect Training videos, you may want to apply by mail. What happens after you apply? It can take several months or longer to hear about your application. Sometimes you might not hear back even if you qualify. While you’re waiting, carefully check what your current lease says about moving out before the lease is over. If you’re offered an apartment, you might need to move quickly. What are my next steps after I apply? If your application is selected, you’ll be invited to respond to a document request. This interview is very important. Agents from the building will confirm if you qualify for the opportunity you applied for. Get ready ahead of time to make sure you’re prepared. What if I never hear back? If you aren’t selected or don’t hear back, keep searching for other apartments and apply when you are ready.
